## Overview

### The challenge

The project challenge involves building a single-page application that meets the criteria for a Progressive Web App (PWA). The application will be designed with various data persistence techniques to ensure redundancy, in the event that one option is not supported by the user's browser. A key feature of this app will be its ability to function offline, ensuring seamless user experience regardless of connectivity.
